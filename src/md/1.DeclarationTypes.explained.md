# Explanation: src/content/1.DeclarationTypes.js

This file is a learning note that introduces JavaScript variable declarations and related concepts. It contains explanatory comments and a few small code snippets to illustrate behavior. There’s no runtime logic; it’s designed to be read, not executed.

Below is a structured explanation of everything covered in that file, plus a couple of clarifications and best practices.

## 1) Declaration keywords: const, let, var

- const
  - Meaning: a variable whose binding cannot be reassigned.
  - You must initialize it when you declare it.
  - Example: const fullName = "Shivanshu Pareek";
  - You cannot do: fullName = "Someone Else"; // TypeError
  - Scope: block-scoped.

- let
  - Meaning: a mutable variable (you can reassign a new value).
  - Initialization can be done later.
  - Example:
    - let firstName = "Shivanshu";
    - firstName = "John"; // reassigning is allowed
    - let lastName; // declared without initialization
    - lastName = "Pareek"; // initialized later
  - Scope: block-scoped.

- var (legacy; avoid)
  - Historically the only keyword before ES2015.
  - Function-scoped (not block-scoped) and hoisted in a way that can cause surprises.
  - Redeclaration is allowed within the same scope, which can mask bugs.
  - Example pitfalls:
    - var x = 1; var x = 2; // allowed, silently overwrites
    - for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { /* ... */ }
      // i leaks outside the block after the loop completes
  - Today, prefer const and let.

Summary rule of thumb:
- Default to const; use let only when you need to reassign. Avoid var in modern code.

## 2) Reassigning vs Redeclaring

- Reassigning
  - Changing the value of an existing variable without using a declaration keyword.
  - Works for let and var, not for const.
  - Example:
    - let a = 10;
    - a = 20; // reassigning

- Redeclaring
  - Declaring the same variable name again in the same scope with a declaration keyword.
  - let: NOT allowed in the same scope (SyntaxError).
  - const: NOT allowed in the same scope (SyntaxError), and must initialize.
  - var: allowed (legacy behavior), which can hide bugs.
  - Example:
    - let b = 100;
    - let b = 200; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
    - var c = 1;
    - var c = 2; // allowed; second declaration overwrites c

## 3) Scoping and Hoisting

- Scope types you’ll encounter in this context:
  - Global scope: reachable anywhere (e.g., variables defined at top level in a script; in browsers, var at top level attaches to window). Global variables make code harder to maintain.
  - Function scope: scope created by a function body. var is function-scoped.
  - Block scope: scope created by { ... } blocks (if, for, while, try/catch, etc.). let and const are block-scoped.
  - Lexical scope: variables are resolved based on where functions are defined, not where they’re called. This underlies closures.

- Hoisting (high level):
  - Declarations are processed before execution.
  - var declarations are hoisted and initialized to undefined, enabling use before declaration (but value is undefined until assignment).
  - let/const are hoisted but not initialized, which creates the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). Accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError.
  - Example (illustrative):
    - console.log(x); // undefined (var is hoisted and initialized)
    - var x = 1;
    - console.log(y); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
    - let y = 2;

## 4) Best Practices

- Prefer const by default; switch to let only when you must reassign.
- Avoid var in modern code; legacy code may still contain var.
- Keep variable scope as small as possible; declare variables close to where they’re used.
- Avoid reusing names across scopes in ways that can be confusing (shadowing) unless intentional.

## 5) Notes about the original file

- The code is primarily comments intended for learning purposes. Importing it via a script tag will not produce visible output (which is fine for notes, but you may want to render explanations in HTML/Markdown for a site).
- The SCOPING section in the original file briefly introduces scope types but stops mid-way. The “Scoping and Hoisting” section above completes that explanation with practical guidance.

## 6) Quick glossary

- Declaration: introducing a new variable name to a scope (with let/const/var).
- Initialization: assigning the first value at the time of declaration.
- Reassignment: assigning a new value to an existing variable later on.
- Redeclaration: declaring the same name again in the same scope (allowed only with var; not with let/const).
- Hoisting: the JavaScript engine’s process of moving declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
- TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone): the time between the start of a block and the actual declaration of let/const where the variable exists but is not initialized; touching it throws ReferenceError.
