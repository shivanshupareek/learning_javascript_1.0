# Explanation: src/content/1.DeclarationKeywords.js

This document explains the lessons and comments contained in src/content/1.DeclarationKeywords.js. The JS file is a learning note; it’s meant to be read, not executed. Below is a structured, practical guide matching its topics.

## 1) Declaration keywords: const, let, var

- const
  - Meaning: a binding that cannot be reassigned.
  - Must be initialized at declaration time.
  - Example: const fullName = "Shivanshu Pareek";
  - Reassignment: fullName = "Other"; // TypeError
  - Scope: block-scoped.

- let
  - Meaning: a mutable binding (you can reassign a new value).
  - Can be declared without initializing, then assigned later.
  - Example:
    - let firstName = "Shivanshu";
    - firstName = "John"; // allowed
    - let lastName; // declared without init
    - lastName = "Pareek"; // initialized later
  - Scope: block-scoped.

- var (legacy; avoid in modern code)
  - Pre-ES2015 keyword; function-scoped and hoisted in a surprising way.
  - Allows redeclaration in the same scope.
  - Example pitfalls:
    - var x = 1; var x = 2; // allowed; silently overwrites
    - for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { /* ... */ }
      // i leaks outside the block
  - Prefer const/let today.

Rule of thumb: default to const; use let when you must reassign; avoid var.

## 2) Initialization, Reassignment, and Redeclaration

- Initialization
  - Giving the first value at the moment of declaration.
  - You must initialize const; let/var can be declared without an initial value.

- Reassignment
  - Updating the value of an existing variable without a declaration keyword.
  - Works for let and var; not allowed for const.

- Redeclaration
  - Declaring the same name again in the same scope using a keyword.
  - const/let: not allowed in the same scope (SyntaxError).
  - var: allowed (legacy) — can hide bugs.

## 3) Scope and Hoisting Essentials

- Scope types
  - Global: visible everywhere. In browsers, top-level var attaches to window.
  - Function scope: created by function bodies. var is function-scoped.
  - Block scope: created by { ... } (if/for/while/try/catch). let/const are block-scoped.

- Hoisting and TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
  - Declarations are processed before execution.
  - var is hoisted and initialized to undefined; can be referenced before declaration (value is undefined until assignment).
  - let/const are hoisted but not initialized, creating the TDZ; touching them before their declaration throws ReferenceError.

Illustration:

```js
console.log(x); // undefined (var hoisted and initialized)
var x = 1;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let y = 2;
```

## 4) Best Practices

- Prefer const by default; switch to let only when you truly need reassignment.
- Avoid var in modern code; you’ll still see it in legacy code.
- Keep scope small; declare variables close to where they’re used.
- Avoid confusing shadowing unless intentional.

## 5) Notes about the original JS file

- The JS file is predominantly comments for learning. Importing it will not produce output (which is fine for notes).
- Examples inside demonstrate initialization, reassignment (let), and why const prevents reassignment.

## 6) Quick glossary

- Declaration: introducing a variable name to a scope (let/const/var).
- Initialization: assigning its first value at declaration time.
- Reassignment: later assigning a new value to the same variable.
- Redeclaration: declaring the same name again in the same scope; allowed only with var.
- Hoisting: the engine processes declarations before execution.
- TDZ: window before let/const is initialized where access throws ReferenceError.
